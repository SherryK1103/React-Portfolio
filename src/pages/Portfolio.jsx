            The SEO HTML Refactor assignment was my first project at the
            NorthWestern University Coding Bootcamp. We were given a webpage

            changing it from non-semantic elements to semantic elements to
            improve SEO as well as comply with AAA standards. This assignment
            displayed the skills I had learned in HTML and CSS.
